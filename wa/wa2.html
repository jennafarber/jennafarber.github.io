<p> Hi! My name is Jenna Farber. I use she/her pronouns. 
    My goals for this class is to feel comfortable with HTML and to really understand what goes into bulding and viewing a website.
    A little bit about myself: I am from Washington D.C. I absolutly love all things music including mixing music! When I'm not DJ'ing, you can find me hangingout with my friends, going on drives to the mountians or learning in class.</p>

<p> This picture was taken last year of me mixing music in my friends room. I love to see how far I have come in just a short amount of time!</p>

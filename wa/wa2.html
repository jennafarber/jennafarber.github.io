        <h2>My name is <a href="img/DjPic.JPG">Jenna Farber</a></h2>
        <p> I use she/her pronouns </p>
        <p>My goals for this class is to feel comfortable with HTML and to really understand what goes into building and viewing a website.</p>
        <p>A little bit about myself: I am from Washington D.C. I absolutely love all things music including mixing music! When I'm not DJ'ing, you can find me hanging-out with my friends, going on drives to the mountains and skiing or learning in class.</p>
        <p>This picture was taken last year of me mixing music in my friends room. I love to see how far I have come in just a short amount of time!</p>

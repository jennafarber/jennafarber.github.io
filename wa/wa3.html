        <p> A disc jockey, more commonly abbreviated as DJ, is a person who plays recorded music for an audience. 
            Types of DJs include radio DJs (who host programs on music radio stations), 
            club DJs (who work at a nightclub or music festival), mobile DJs (who are hired to work at public and private events such as weddings, parties, or festivals), 
            and turntablists (who use record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records). </p>

            <h3> Where does "Disk Jockey" come from?</h3>
        <p>The term "disc jockey" was ostensibly coined by radio gossip commentator Walter Winchell in 1935, 
            and the phrase first appeared in print in a 1941 Variety magazine. 
            Originally, the word "disc" in "disc jockey" referred to phonograph or gramophone records and was used to describe radio personalities who introduced them on the air</p>

            <h4>What is a DJ's Role?</h4>
        <p>"DJ" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including vinyl records, cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files stored on USB stick or laptop. 
            DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In hip hop music, DJs may create beats, using percussion breaks, basslines and other musical content sampled from pre-existing records.
            Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as techno, house or hip hop music. DJs typically have extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.</p>
